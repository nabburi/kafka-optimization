Yes! Letâ€™s break it down. This is the output of:  

```bash
kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe
```
showing **test-topic** with **three partitions (0, 1, and 2)** distributed across **three brokers (1, 2, and 3)**.  

---

### **Key Fields Explained:**
1. **Partition** â€“ The partition number within the topic.  
2. **Leader** â€“ The broker currently leading (handling reads/writes) for that partition.  
3. **Replicas** â€“ The list of brokers storing a copy of the partition (both leader and followers).  
4. **ISR (In-Sync Replicas)** â€“ The replicas that are currently in sync with the leader.  
5. **Elr (Eligible Replicas for Leader Election)** â€“ Not applicable in your case.  
6. **LastKnownElr** â€“ Not applicable either.

### **Partition Breakdown:**
| **Partition** | **Leader** | **Replicas** | **ISR** |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 0           | **2**       | 2,3         | 2,3     |
| 1           | **3**       | 3,1         | 3,1     |
| 2           | **1**       | 1,2         | 1,2     |

### **What This Means:**
- **Each partition has a single leader** responsible for handling read and write requests.  
- **Each partition has two replicas** (a leader and at least one follower).  
- **All replicas are in ISR**, meaning they are fully caught up and available.  

---

### **How It Relates to Your Chaos Test**
1. If you **kill Broker 2**, partition 0 will **lose its leader**, and Kafka will elect a new leader from ISR (likely Broker 3).  
2. The ISR for partition 2 will shrink to just **Broker 1** since Broker 2 is down.  
3. When you restart Broker 2, it should rejoin ISR and catch up on missing data.


**Kill Broker 2**

Since you're running Kafka in Docker, stop the container for Broker 2:

docker stop kafka-broker-2

(Replace kafka-broker-2 with the actual container name if different.)
Check ISR Shrinkage and Leader Re-Election

Run:

kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe

Expected Changes:
Partition	Old Leader	New Leader?	Old ISR	New ISR?
0	2	3? (or 1)	2,3	3 only
1	3	No Change	3,1	3,1 (same)
2	1	No Change	1,2	1 only

ðŸ”¹ Partition 0 should now have a new leader (likely Broker 3).
ðŸ”¹ ISR for partitions 0 and 2 should shrink (since Broker 2 is down).

Test Message Flow During Failure
Produce Messages

Open a producer on an active broker and send test messages:

kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test-topic

Type a few messages and hit Enter.
Consume Messages

In another terminal, consume messages:

kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test-topic --from-beginning

âœ… Messages should still be produced and consumed despite Broker 2 being down.
Step 4: Restart Broker 2

Now, bring Broker 2 back online:

docker start kafka-broker-2

Wait a few seconds, then re-run:

kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe

Expected Recovery:

    Broker 2 should rejoin ISR for partitions 0 and 2.
    If Broker 2 was the original leader for partition 0, it may not regain leadership immediately (Kafka may leave Broker 3 as the new leader).

**The reason you see 50 partitions for the __consumer_offsets topic is that it is an internal Kafka topic used for consumer group coordination and offset tracking.Why Does __consumer_offsets Have 50 Partitions?**

    Kafka's Default Configuration:
        The __consumer_offsets topic is automatically created when Kafka starts.
        By default, it has 50 partitions to ensure high throughput and scalability when tracking consumer offsets.

    Consumer Group Coordination:
        This topic stores the last read offset of each consumer in a consumer group.
        Having multiple partitions allows Kafka to distribute this load across multiple brokers, preventing bottlenecks.

    Scalability & Performance:
        Since Kafka can support thousands of consumer groups, having 50 partitions helps balance load across multiple brokers.
        Each partition handles a subset of consumer groups, improving efficiency.

Do You Need to Change This?

No, you don't need to modify __consumer_offsets. It is managed internally by Kafka and should remain as-is for optimal performance.

For your test-topic, you have 3 partitions (which is controlled by your configuration), and that is where your actual data will be stored.

**The ISR for the `__consumer_offsets` topic showing only Brokers 1 and 3, and not Broker 2, suggests that Broker 2 might not have caught up with the partition replication or may not be properly synced with the cluster.**

**NOT YET FIXED**
**How to make a broker that got crashed and got back up to get in sync with all the consumer offset partitions and consumer offset ISR to update to elect the leaders if all the ISR is only pointing to non crashed ones?**
**How to rebalance leader election**

This could happen for several reasons: 

### Possible Causes:
1. **Broker 2 Lagging Behind:**
   - Broker 2 might not have replicated the logs for the `__consumer_offsets` topic fully, which results in it not being included in the ISR. This is often the case if Broker 2 was down or lagging for a while, and the replication process has not fully caught up yet.

2. **Broker 2 Is Not Fully Syncing with the Cluster:**
   - Kafka requires all replicas to be in sync with the leader for them to be considered in the ISR. If Broker 2 hasn't been able to catch up with the leader (Broker 1), it won't be included in the ISR.

3. **Partition Leader on Broker 1:**
   - Since Broker 1 is the leader for most partitions of the `__consumer_offsets` topic, it is possible that Broker 2 is simply not fully in sync due to heavy load or lag in replication for those partitions.

4. **Replication Issues:**
   - There may be issues with the replication process, such as network or disk I/O bottlenecks on Broker 2, preventing it from syncing properly with Broker 1. If replication is delayed for too long, Kafka may drop Broker 2 from the ISR temporarily.

5. **Broker 2 Recovery Issues:**
   - If Broker 2 has been down or out of sync for an extended period, Kafka may temporarily exclude it from the ISR list. It may require a manual intervention to bring it back in sync.

### Suggested Steps to Investigate:
1. **Check Broker 2 Logs:**
   - Inspect Broker 2 logs for any warnings or errors related to replication or syncing. This could give insights into why it's not in the ISR.
   ```bash
   docker logs <broker_2_container_id>
   ```

2. **Monitor Replication Lag:**
   - Check the replication lag for the `__consumer_offsets` topic on Broker 2. Use `kafka-consumer-groups.sh` or `kafka-topics.sh` to monitor the replication state and lag.
   ```bash
   kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --group <group_name>
   ```

3. **Force Replication Sync:**
   - You can try to force Broker 2 to catch up by producing more messages or forcing a partition reassignment.
   ```bash
   kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --reassignment-json-file <reassignment-file>.json --execute
   ```

4. **Check if Broker 2 is Healthy:**
   - Verify Broker 2's health status by checking the broker API versions:
   ```bash
   kafka-broker-api-versions.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
   ```

5. **Rebalance Partitions (If Needed):**
   - If Broker 2 is still lagging behind, consider running a partition reassignment and rebalancing the replicas.

---

By identifying the root cause and addressing it, Broker 2 should eventually rejoin the ISR and stay in sync with the rest of the cluster. 

**When taking two brokers down at a same time**

In a Kafka cluster, each partition must have a leader that handles all reads and writes for that partition. If a partition does not have a leader, it cannot be read from or written to, which would cause issues for consumers and producers.

In your case, since two partitions (Partition 0 and Partition 5) do not have a leader (Leader: none), this is not expected behavior, and the partitions are effectively unavailable for writes or reads until a leader is assigned.
Why does this happen?

    Leader election failure: When you killed two brokers simultaneously, Kafka tried to elect a new leader for the affected partitions. However, since there are only three brokers in total and two were down, Kafka could not successfully elect a leader for partitions 0 and 5 (because the required number of in-sync replicas or ISRs for these partitions were not available).

    Replication Factor and ISRs: You have a replication factor of 2, which means that each partition has two replicas. If both brokers responsible for those partitions are down, the replicas will not be available to elect a new leader, leading to the situation you are seeing (Leader: none).

What should happen:

    Leader election process: Kafka will automatically attempt to reassign a leader if the current leader fails, based on the in-sync replicas (ISR). However, this is only possible if there are enough replicas in sync. If there aren't enough replicas in sync (due to brokers being down), Kafka won't be able to elect a leader for those partitions.

    ISR (In-Sync Replicas): The ISR for each partition must contain at least one replica other than the leader. If a partition's ISR is reduced to just one replica, then the partition cannot elect a leader.

What you can do:

    Bring the brokers back online: Once the two brokers are back online, Kafka should be able to elect new leaders for the affected partitions. This is the best solution as it will restore the partition availability.

    Check ISR status: Use the kafka-topics --describe command or the kafka-consumer-groups --describe command to check the ISR status for your partitions. You will see the ISRs, and if any partition has only one replica in the ISR, it means that the other broker replica is unavailable.

    Rebalance the cluster: If the partitions are still in an unhealthy state after the brokers are back online, you can trigger a rebalance of the cluster by running the following command:

kafka-reassign-partitions --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --execute --reassignment-json-file <json_file_with_reassignment>


Investigate the logs: Check the broker logs (server.log) to see why the leader election failed. It might provide more insights into the issue.

In this case, Broker 1 (the leader for partitions 1, 2, 3, and 4) is overburdened with being the leader for four out of the six partitions, while Broker 3 is only leading partitions 0 and 5. Ideally, Kafka should spread the leadership load more evenly across the available brokers.
Why this happens:

    Kafka's leader election algorithm attempts to assign the leader of each partition based on the replication factor, ISR, and broker availability.
    Balanced leader election: In general, Kafka strives to balance the leadership load, but it prioritizes maintaining a consistent ISR (i.e., making sure that a partition's leader is always available with a sufficient number of replicas in sync).
    After restarting brokers, Kafka may end up with unbalanced leader assignments if it doesn't get a chance to perform a full rebalance or if partitions are not reassigned based on the optimal distribution.

Replication and ISR Maintenance:

    When you delete partition logs from a broker, Kafka doesn't immediately shrink the ISR for the affected partition because the broker is still actively communicating with the cluster and might still be holding onto the partition's state in its internal memory.
    Kafka periodically checks the ISR and the health of replicas, but the process of shrinking ISR typically takes time and depends on the Kafka replication settings.

ISR Shrinking Process:

    Kafka checks the health of replicas through regular heartbeats and replica fetcher threads. If a replica is down or unreachable, it may be removed from the ISR. But this check doesn't happen immediately after deleting log files.
    The broker where the partition logs were deleted might still be considered part of the ISR for some time, and Kafka will only shrink the ISR after the replica fails to join the replication process or after some time passes without replication.
